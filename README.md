# voltageController
Voltage controller for over polorization control


Arduino controller for usage to meassure polorization voltage on a cathodicly protected surface.

by reading voltage and setting threshholds it limits the sacraficial andoes ability to overpolorize, and damage underwater components

built using an Arduino mega

supplies needed
Arduino mega
low impedince contactor 100% duty cycle
5v activation relay
LED's of choice
optional code for data logger
ref cell
